Let's break down the DNS query data you've received to determine whether you've got the correct data from the client. This is the raw data sent by the client, which is typically in hexadecimal format.

### Breakdown of the Client's DNS Query:

**Client Data**:
```
1d 6a 00 20 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 01 07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 63 6f 6d 00 00 01 00 01 00 00 29 04 d0 00 00 00 00 00 0c 00 0a 00 08 6b 36 a3 a4 31 f8 69 6a
```

This packet is 52 bytes long, and it's formatted according to the DNS wire protocol. Here's the detailed breakdown:

### 1. **Transaction ID** (Bytes 0-1):
```
  1d 6a
```
- This is the transaction ID, a unique identifier for the request. It should match the same in the response.
- **Transaction ID: 0x1d6a**

### 2. **Flags** (Bytes 2-3):
```
00 20
```
- This part represents the DNS flags.
  - `0x00 0x20`: The flags indicate it's a query, with no special response flags (standard query).
  - The second byte (`0x20`) is related to recursion (indicating recursion desired).

### 3. **Number of Questions** (Bytes 4-5):
```
00 01
```
- This shows that there is 1 question in the query.

### 4. **Number of Answers, Authority Records, and Additional Records** (Bytes 6-11):
```
00 00 00 00 00 01
```
- These fields are all set to 0 because the query doesn't include answers, authority, or additional sections.
- Specifically:
  - Answers: `00 00`
  - Authority: `00 00`
  - Additional: `00 01` (1 question section)

### 5. **Question Section** (Bytes 12-27):
```
07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 63 6f 6d 00 00 01 00 01
```
- **Domain Name**: `07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 63 6f 6d 00`
  - `07`: Length of the first label, which is `example` (7 characters).
  - `65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65`: ASCII values for `example`.
  - `03`: Length of the second label, `com` (3 characters).
  - `63 6f 6d`: ASCII values for `com`.
  - `00`: Null byte, marking the end of the domain name.
- **Type (A record)**: `00 01`
  - `0x0001`: The query is for an `A` record (IPv4 address).
- **Class (IN)**: `00 01`
  - `0x0001`: The class is `IN` (Internet).

### 6. **Additional Section** (Bytes 28-51):
```
00 00 29 04 d0 00 00 00 00 00 0c 00 0a 00 08 6b 36 a3 a4 31 f8 69 6a
```
- These bytes are part of the DNS message but aren't part of the standard question or answer sections. They could be padding or additional data in the packet but are not relevant for standard DNS queries. This part might be specific to your setup or client behavior.

### Summary of Client Query:
The key section of your DNS query contains:
- **Transaction ID**: `1d 6a`
- **Flags**: Standard query, recursion desired
- **Question Section**: Query for the A record of `example.com`
  - **Domain Name**: `example.com`
  - **Type**: A record (`0x0001`)
  - **Class**: IN (`0x0001`)

### Is This the Correct Data?
- The domain in the query is `example.com`, not `hello` (which you might have expected from the command). This means that your query isn't asking for `hello` but for `example.com`.
- The type (`A` record) and class (`IN`) are correct for a typical DNS query.

### What To Do Next:
- If you want to respond to queries for `hello` (as mentioned in your previous requests), you need to either:
  1. Adjust the client query to request `hello` instead of `example.com`.
  2. Modify your DNS server to recognize and respond to the `hello` query (instead of `example.com`).

To test it for `hello`, you can issue the `dig` command like this:
```bash
dig +norecurse -4 @127.0.0.1 -p 8080 hello
```

The data youâ€™ve received is correct **for the query you made** (which was for `example.com`), but if you intended to query for `hello`, you need to make sure the query and server are aligned.
